    <title> My Reaction to the "In Time" Movie - G8_Miguel Antonio C. Punzalan </title>
    <h1> My Reaction to the "In Time" Movie </h1>

</head>
<body>
    <p> The “In Time” movie is a science fiction and action movie. It is all about buying time with money and shows the world the preciousness and high value of time. In this movie, the people stopped physically aging at age twenty-five, but in the succeeding year, they will die if they will not buy time. Therefore, only the rich people can afford to buy time and enjoy long life, while the poor people they died and live for a short time because they do not have money to buy time. </p>
    
    <p> Fortunately, there was a man named Will Salas, the hero and saved a rich man Henry Hamilton from a gang called the Minutemen. These are the people stealing time from a wealthy person. Although Henry gave up his life and transfer his time to Will. In the end, Will, with the help of Sylvia, fight the Timekeepers, win the battle, and get one million years for the poor and dying people, saving them, and giving back their time and life. </p>
    
    <p> To conclude, I like the movie because it talks about helping each other, not losing hope and giving up. We should enjoy the graces, time, and life we have. Use our time wisely and take care of ourselves. </p>
